Responsive Design - Feb. 15, 2021

Task 2: Minimum Viable Product

Use the checklist below to guide your work today. Your final product should be presentable at mobile, tablet and a desktop-width.

[x] Insert a viewport meta tag into the head of the project with these html attributes: content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"

[x] Introduce max-width media queries into your project at 800px and 500px

[x] Add accessability features to your webpage

[x] Design should closely follow the mobile wireframe given for your chosen layout


Task 3: Stretch Goals

Once you finish the minimum viable project, work on any of the following stretch goals:

[] Test your website at several breakpoints and refactor code as needed. A few common breakpoints are below:
 iPhone: 360×640
 Laptop: 1366×768
 Widescreen: 1920×1080

[] Test your webpage's accessibility with a screen reader like this

[] Start over with min-width media queries to get a feel for how a mobile first approach would be like. I recommend making a branch of all your content in a new folder named "mobile-first" to keep it separate

[] Test your webpage's accessibility with a screen reader like this
